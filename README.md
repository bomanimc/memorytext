#MemoryText
MemoryText is the basic web app that I built to learn Node.js and Express! MemoryText allows users to schedule text messages to be sent at certain time, with the hope that it can help to remind you about something. 

It was a real pain trying to understand how to pass information back and forth between the client-side and server-side, but I finally got it to work (and I'm glad I did).
